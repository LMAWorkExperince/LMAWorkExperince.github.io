the sonar project:
    - the sonar project will need to be polished, commented, documented, sorted.
    - the document will contain:
        - a bref overview of what the project is
        - an explnation on how to play the game
        - any problems that popped up and the solutions do them
        - a explnation on some of the game mechanics such as:
            - sonar particals
            - the movement
    
    - the polish:
        - the game will not have memory leaks
        - the game mechanics must be consistant and not buggy
        - it has to run at a reasonable frame rate
        - it has to be easy to understand what to do

    - the sonar will be done up like a game that will include the following:
        - a game level selection ( min of 2 levels )
        - minimap to display the sonar traces permanently.
        - goal
        - finish condition
        - fail condition
        - score system
        - continuios movement (like how a boat dosent just stop when it turns its motors off)
        - an enemy (bonus)
